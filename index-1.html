<h3 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h3>
<p>Users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
<li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
<li>Receive an error message when the <code>form</code> is submitted if:</li>
<li>Any <code>input</code> field is empty. The message for this error should say <em>"[Field Name] cannot be empty"</em></li>
<li>The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: <code>name@host.tld</code>). The message for this error should say <em>"Looks like this is not an email"</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="screenshot">Screenshot</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="./screenshot.jpg" /></p>
<p>Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a tool like <a href="https://getfireshot.com/">FireShot</a> to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. </p>
<p>Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.</strong></p>
